List out the feature of HTML5 ?
=> HTML5 introduced a wide range of new features and improvements over its predecessors, enhancing the capabilities of web applications. Here are some of the key features of HTML5:

1. New Semantic Elements:
   - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>`: These elements provide better structure and meaning to the content of web pages.

2. New Form Elements and Attributes:
   - New input types: `<input type="email">`, `<input type="url">`, `<input type="number">`, `<input type="range">`, `<input type="date">`, `<input type="color">`, etc.
   - New form attributes: `placeholder`, `autofocus`, `required`, `pattern`, `min`, `max`, `step`, etc.
   - New elements like `<datalist>`, `<output>`, and `<progress>`.

3. Multimedia Support:
   - `<video>` and `<audio>` elements for embedding media content without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
   - Support for different codecs and formats.

4. Canvas and SVG:
   - `<canvas>` element for drawing graphics on the fly using JavaScript.
   - Improved support for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for vector-based graphics.

5. Enhanced Accessibility:
   - Improved semantics with new elements and attributes to support better accessibility for assistive technologies.

6. Local Storage and Offline Capabilities:
   - `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for storing data locally within the user's browser.
   - Application Cache (AppCache) for offline web applications (though deprecated in favor of Service Workers).

7. Geolocation API:
   - Allows web applications to access the geographical location of the user, subject to the userâ€™s consent.

8. Web Workers:
   - Background scripts that run separately from the main execution thread of a web page, allowing for background processing without affecting the user interface.

9. WebSockets:
   - A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection for real-time web applications.


10. Drag and Drop API:
   - Simplifies the process of implementing drag-and-drop functionality in web applications.

11. Improved Markup and Scripting:
   - New global attributes such as `contenteditable`, `spellcheck`, and `draggable`.
   - Improved error handling and consistent parsing rules across browsers.
   - Native support for JSON and DOM Level 2 and 3.

12. Microdata and Custom Data Attributes:
   - Microdata for embedding custom data in HTML tags for better integration with search engines and other applications.
   - Custom data attributes using `data-*` for embedding custom attributes in HTML elements.

13. Responsive Design and Media Queries:
   - Improved support for CSS3 media queries to build responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

14. MathML and WebGL:
   - MathML for displaying mathematical notation.
   - WebGL for rendering interactive 3D graphics within the browser.

15. Improved Forms:
   - Native validation of form inputs with better control over user inputs.

16. History API:
   - Allows manipulation of the browser session history, enabling the creation of single-page applications with back/forward navigation.

17. Server-Sent Events (SSE):
   - A way for servers to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection.

18. Enhanced Mobile Support:
   - Better support for mobile and touch devices with features like touch events and orientation detection.

These features collectively make HTML5 a powerful tool for creating modern, interactive, and user-friendly web applications.
