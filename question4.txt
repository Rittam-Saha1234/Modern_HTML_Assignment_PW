List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
=>1. Semantic HTML: Using semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to structure the content of a webpage can improve accessibility. 
Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on semantic HTML to understand the structure of the page and convey it to users with disabilities.

2. Alt Text for Images: Providing descriptive alt text for images using the alt attribute in the <img> tag ensures that users who are visually impaired or have images disabled can understand the content of the image. 
Alt text should convey the purpose or content of the image in a concise and meaningful way.

3. Keyboard Accessibility: Ensuring that all interactive elements on a webpage can be accessed and operated using a keyboard is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. 
This includes using keyboard shortcuts, focus styles, and ensuring that the tab order follows a logical sequence. 
Keyboard accessibility is essential for users with motor impairments or those who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers.
